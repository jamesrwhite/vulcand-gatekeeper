# Vulcand Gatekeeper

An authentication and [distributed rate limiting](https://github.com/miniclip/gatekeeper) [middleware](https://docs.vulcand.io/middlewares.html) for [vulcand](https://github.com/mailgun/vulcand).

## Building

Create a directory in your GOPATH to be used with your version of vulcand that contains the bundled middleware.

`mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/miniclip/vulcand-gatekeeper`

`cd` into the that directory and initialise the middleware using the `vbundle` command.

`vbundle init --middleware=github.com/miniclip/vulcand-gatekeeper/gatekeeper`

You can now build a new version of the vulcand program with our middleware included like so:

`go build -o vulcand`

Following this we need to build a new version of `vctl` also:

`pushd vctl/ && go build -o vctl && pop`

To test it compiled correctly run `./vctl/vctl gatekeeper --help` and you should see a help menu.

##Â Configuration

You can configure the middleware (i.e specify the header to use add API keys for a frontend) via etcd, an example using `etcdctl` is shown below:

`etcdctl set /vulcand/frontends/f1/middlewares/gatekeeper '{"Type": "gatekeeper", "Middleware":{"Header": "X-API-Key", "Frontend": "f1", "Keys": {"abc": {"Rate": 2}}}}'`

## Roadmap

- [ ] HMAC based request signatures not just API keys
- [ ] Use GoDep for dependencies
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Improved documentation on how to deploy with vulcand
